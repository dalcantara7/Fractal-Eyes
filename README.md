# Fractal Eyes

This project was the completed as part of the graduate requirement for _Engineering Applications of Machine Learning_ as well as my __senior Honors Thesis__ at the University of Arizona. The goal of this project was to use machine learning to differentiate between different types of blood cells and quantify differences in features.

The full version of the research paper-formatted explanation of the system is available [here](https://github.com/dalcantara7/Fractal-Eyes/blob/master/Fractal%20Eyes%20Condensed%20Paper.pdf)

The full honors thesis paper is available [here](https://github.com/dalcantara7/Fractal-Eyes/blob/master/Fractal%20Eyes%20Full%20Thesis.pdf)

__Note: in an effort to make this project more organized I have redone the file structure. The references to dependent files need to be updated. The project will not run in it's current form. However enough explanation and imagery is given between the papers in this GitHub to get the idea.__
